# my ideas 
using the school as a targetted audience i want to use the school color to make the UI more welcoming 

## limitations

 **1 System Constraints**
 No Home-to-School Service - emphasis here 
- Students & staff can **only book for the return trip (school to bus stop)** but not **home to school**.  
- This might **inconvenience users** who want a full two-way service.  
- Possible **solution**: Consider future updates to allow **home-to-school bookings**.  

 **Limited Bus Routes**  
- The system is designed **only for one specific school**.  
- If the school expands routes or new campuses are added, the system may need major modifications.  

 **Fixed Seating System**  
- Users **must select seats**, which can cause issues:  
  - If a bus gets delayed, students may **miss their booked seat**.  
  - If someone doesn’t show up, their seat goes **unused** unless there’s an auto-cancel system.  
- **Solution**: Add a **real-time seat update** or an **auto-cancel after X minutes** feature.

 **2️ Technical Limitations**
 **No Offline Support**  
- If there's **no internet**, students **cannot book tickets** ( considering nigeria bad internet connection).  
- Consider **progressive web app (PWA) features** to allow **offline booking** with sync when online. ( review on this ) 

 **Backend Scalability Issues**  
- If too many students/staff **book at the same time**, the system could **slow down**.  
- Ensure the backend can **handle concurrent requests efficiently**.  

 **Real-Time Updates**  
- If multiple users book at the same time, **seat availability issues** can arise.  
- Solution: Use **WebSockets or Firebase real-time database** for instant updates.

 **3️ Payment & Ticketing Challenges**
 **Handling Payments (If Any would be done online )**  
- If tickets are **paid**, integrating a **payment gateway** securely is crucial.  
- Refunds & failed transactions **must be handled properly**.  

 **Fake or Shared Tickets** (review this ) 
- Students **may share tickets** (e.g., screenshot QR codes).  
- Solution: **Generate dynamic QR codes** that refresh frequently.  

 **Bus Capacity Mismanagement**  
- If students don’t board, some buses might **run empty** while others are **overloaded**.  
- Solution: Use **smart scheduling** to balance loads.  

---

 **4️ User & Management Issues**
 **New Users & Role Management**  
- How will **new students/staff** be added?  
- What if a **staff member leaves**—how does their access get revoked?  

 **Booking Restrictions & Cancellations**  
- If someone **books but doesn’t show up**, does the system allow rebooking?  
- What’s the **cancellation policy** (free, refund, or penalty)?

 **Possible Improvements**
1. **Add "Home-to-School" Option** in the future.  
2. **Optimize booking & seat allocation** (dynamic seating, auto-cancellation).  
3. **Use real-time updates** to avoid overbooking.  
4. **Improve security** (QR validation, login authentication).
