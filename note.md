## NOTES 
Angular is an application-design framework and development platform for creating efficient and sophisticated single-page apps.

## fixes
run this `npm config set registry http://registry.npmjs.org/` to make npm install faster 
try to install n 
try to install node lts 
try to `npm install --nodedir=/node/src/`
try `npm i -g node-gyp@latest`
try `npm i <module> --legacy-peer-deps` 
give up and cry ! :)

come back and try to change the npm registry 
. npm config set registry http://registry.npmjs.org/ --- using this now and showing possitive result 
. npm config set registry http://registry.npmjs.cf/ -- tried this and it didnt go well 
. npm config set registry https://registry.npmmirror.com
